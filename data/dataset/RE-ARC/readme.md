# RE-ARC: Reverse-Engineering the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

## Notes

The `re_arc.zip` contains 400 ARC tasks, each having 1000 pairs.

The `RE-ARC` file format is different than the original ARC file format.

I have extracted a tiny subset of only the `easy` and the `hard` tasks.

The script `export.py` does the extraction of `easy` and `hard`.
Place the script in the root dir of the `RE-ARC` repo, and run it.
